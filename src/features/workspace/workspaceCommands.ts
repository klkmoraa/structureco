/**
 * Typed command bus for the workspace shell.
 *
 * The panels of the workspace — TopBar, canvas, Inspector, results dock, classroom guide —
 * cannot reach each other through the project store, because what they exchange are
 * *intentions* ("centre this object", "expand the results sheet") rather than state.
 * They used raw `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('structureco:…'))`, with the name
 * spelled out at 27 call sites and a `detail` typed as `any`. A typo in either produced
 * silence, not an error.
 *
 * The transport is unchanged — still a `CustomEvent` on `window`, so anything already
 * listening keeps working — but the name and the payload now have one definition each.
