 * object identity cannot tell a new node apart from a new unit system. Anything
 * that only affects presentation — units, language, diagram scale, layers — is
 * deliberately absent here, so changing it never discards results that are
 * still exact. `settings.calculationMode` *is* included because the solver
 * branches on it.
 *
 * Memoised per project object: the callers share one computation per change.
