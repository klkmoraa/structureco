/**
 * Fails the build when the initial download grows past its declared ceiling.
 *
 * `measure-performance.mjs` has always been able to report bundle composition, but nothing
 * ever *asserted* on it: the numbers were printed and then drifted silently. That is exactly how the
 * animation library landed in the entry chunk and pushed the initial download from
 * 148 531 gzip to 195 360 gzip without a single check going red.
 *
 * This script closes that hole. It re-uses the measurement script as the single source of
 * truth (spawned with `--json`) rather than re-implementing the walk, so the budget can
 * never be checked against a different definition of "initial load" than the one the
 * performance document reports.
 *
 * Usage: npm run build && node scripts/check-performance-budget.mjs

/**
 * Ceilings for what the browser must download before first paint.
 *
 * Provenance — these are NOT aspirational targets, they are the measured value plus a
 * deliberate 3 % of headroom so that ordinary content edits (a few translation keys, a CSS
 * rule) do not fail the gate, while a new library or an eagerly-imported feature does.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-07 after the second visual-fidelity pass: 691 205 bytes, 182 809 gzip.
 * The additional clay control vocabulary is intentional CSS for the official brandbook;
 * the ceiling is re-based here with a small margin instead of hiding the visual work in
 * an untracked override.
 *
 * Why the ceiling moved. The previous pair (648 000 / 174 000) came from a 2026-08-03
 * measurement of 629 337 / 169 132. By the time AG-015 started, `main` already measured
 * 639 791 / 171 997 — three feature commits had quietly eaten 10 454 bytes of that 3 % of
 * headroom without ever tripping the gate, which is exactly the drift this script exists to
 * make visible. AG-015 itself adds 11 316 bytes / 2 358 gzip: a restructured token layer and
 * a rewritten welcome surface, both of which are pure CSS in the entry chunk. That cost is
 * deliberate and was authorised as a design decision, so the ceiling is re-based on the new
 * measurement rather than the redesign being trimmed to fit a stale number.
 *
 * KNOWN DEBT: this is still above the 0.8.1 baseline of 556 000 bytes / 148 531 gzip. The
 * gap is the animation core (`m` + `AnimatePresence` + `LazyMotion`) that the welcome
 * screen pulls into the entry chunk. AG-015 deliberately drove its new hero animation from
 * CSS instead of `motion` so as not to deepen that debt, but the card hovers and the
 * `AnimatePresence` filter reflow still need it. Lowering this ceiling means porting those
 * two to CSS as well; until that decision is made, the ceiling holds the line where it is
 * instead of letting it drift further.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-09 after Phase 2: 700 803 bytes, 186 239 gzip. Project Hub, DXF,
 * PWA lifecycle, command execution and their Phase 2 catalogs are loaded on demand; the
 * remaining 9 598 bytes / 3 430 gzip over the previous measurement are the intentional
 * local-first and compatibility integration in the initial shell. The ceilings below
 * restore the documented 3 % measured headroom without masking an eager feature bundle.
